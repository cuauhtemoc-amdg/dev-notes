# dev-notes
This repo contains a variety of general SW development notes on various topics. Primarily it is intended to remind me how to use various tools and perform certain operations. I have made the repo public if it helps others with the information I have collected here.

Note that I don't claim to have a perfect understanding of the topics I have documented here. I am mostly documenting what has worked well for me in the past. I also realize that my notes may go out of date regularly, especially with evolving tools/technology. But this is where git helps capture the day/time/revision of when I created/updated the document.
